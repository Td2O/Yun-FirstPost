# Yun-FirstPost
First try to make a POST to AirTable with my new Arduino Yùn

The big picture for this project is to create a connected spray system to water my plants while I'm away.
I want to descover IoT and coding by doing this project.
I largely inspired from the work from stregoi (https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Plant-Monitor/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email)

#Hardware
I'm going to use an Arduino Yùn to get data from my plants (mostly from moisture sensors) and to controls pumps.
All the data will be stored in an AirTable Data Base.

#This Code
In this Code, i'll try to make my fist API calls, one Get and One Post.
